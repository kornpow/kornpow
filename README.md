## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## I am currently looking for a new role
My favorite things are Python, Cloud Infrastructure, PCB design, biology and hydroponics, and Bitcoin. But I am always looking for cool new projects to work on.

Recently, like many others, AI has transformed the way I do work. Using flagship models, like Claude, or locally running LLMs on my Macbook, or my server, I am constantly impressed, yet dismayed at the progress.

Dismayed, not because my job is at risk, but because I can see how useful the technology is, yet I am only scratching the surface.

I love to cross-pollinate ideas across all of my different passions and interests. Sometimes it is exhausting, but in the end it ways makes sense.

## I can take apart the remote control... and I can almost put it back together
