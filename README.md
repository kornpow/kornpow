# Hello there, fellow developer üõπüßë‚Äçüíª

## I am currently looking for a new role
My favorite things are Python, Cloud Infrastructure, PCB design, biology and hydroponics, and Bitcoin. But I am always looking for cool new projects to work on.

Please reach out if you want to collaborate, or if you are hiring. It has been a tough job market, but somebody is going to get lucky and hire me. Just like I am going to be lucky to have a great new job.

I am a loyal employee to good companies, and I strive to provide value and push up the bar. 

## AI
Recently, like many others, AI has transformed the way I do work. Using flagship models, like Claude, or locally running LLMs on my Macbook, or my server, I am constantly impressed by what can be done. It takes a lot to keep up with the developments, and even though I feel like I use the tools well, I am constantly learning to use them better.

Software jobs will not go away, they will just be taken by people who use the tools, in the best way.


## I can take apart the remote control... and I can almost put it back together
I love to cross-pollinate ideas across all of my different passions and interests. Sometimes it is exhausting, but especially in the past few years, the over-arching narrative is starting to make sense.
